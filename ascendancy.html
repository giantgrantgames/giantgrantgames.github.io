											<h2>Ascendancy</h2>
										<p>
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ascendancy is an upcoming Turn-based Strategy game by Giant Grant Games. Ascendancy looks to make a splash in the stagnant pond of Turn-based strategy with fresh and innovative mechanics.
											There are Four core aspects that define Ascendancy. Terrain, the Brave ability system, the Upgrade system, and the dynamic AI.
											
										</p>
											
										<p>
										<h2> Terrain Matters </h2>
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Ascendancy the map matters. Pieces of terrain are very powerful tools, and using them to your advantage is required to be successful. From the basics of providing
											cover to advanced strategies such as cutting off reinforcements, protecting flanks, and crippling enemies, proper use of terrain in Ascendancy is the key to successful combat. <br/ ><br />
											
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Abilities in Ascendancy focus on creating, destroying, and manipulating terrain. Interesting and unique effects allow the player to both metaphorically and literally take the high ground from their opponent.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										<h2>The Brave Ability System</h2>
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brave is the resource mechanic in Ascendancy. Often Turn-Based Strategy use resources as a limiter on a player's actions. Traditionally, you start with a pool of a resource, powerful abilities take a lot of resource, weak abilities take few
											resource. Once you're out of resources, you're done. <br /><br />
											This style of play has two major flaws: <br />
										<ul>
										<li>1) it encourages finding the 'best' (read: most efficient per cost) ability and only using it</li>
										<li>2) When the resource is dried up, it slows gameplay to a crawl</li> 
										</ul>
										
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of each battle in Ascendancy, each character starts with a number of Brave equal to 1/2 their maximum Brave. This number is generally between 1-4 Brave. Additional Brave is generated through attacking enemies. An attack will always grant a Brave, hit or miss.
											Each ability has a Brave cost. The first ability a character has a cost of 1 Brave, the second 2 Brave, and the Ultimate ability costs 4 Brave. These abilities are powerful, and intelligent use of them is the only way to progress in Ascendancy. <br /><br / >
										
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This system has two primary advantages:<br / >
										
										
										<ul>
										<li>1) the 'best' abilities cannot be used in rapid succession. A character with a pool of 4 Brave would only be able to use his 2 Brave cost ability twice before resorting to attacks.</li>
										<li>2) Instead of slowing down gameplay when resources are depleted, Brave forces aggression.</li> 
										</ul>
										
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brave addresses the two core problems with traditional resource mechanics to create a gameplay environment with greatly reduced levels of stagnation.
										</p>
										
										
										
										<p>
										<h2>Interesting Upgrades</h2>
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The core philosophy for Ascendancy is an interesting upgrade system for abilities. In Ascendancy you control 10 characters in a Turn-based environment, each character has three unique abilities and a unique passive
											that defines their playstyle. Additionally as you progress through the game, each character gets five upgrades to their abilities. The upgrade philosophy for Ascendancy is as such: Each upgrade choice gives two options, first is an option that
											directly increases the power level of the ability, while the second upgrade significantly changes how the ability works, either making it more powerful in niche situations, or adding new dynamic opportunities to use it. 
										</p>
										<p>
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Example: The Sunder ability on the Blacksmith. Sunder deals damage and decreases the Armor of the target by 3 (Returning at a rate of 1/round). Inherently Sunder is a team-play ability. While the Blacksmith's damage output is low, removing armor allows 
											his team to more easily dispatch bulky targets. As you progress through Ascendancy, the Blacksmith is presented with a pair of exclusive upgrades to Sunder.
											<ul>
												<li>1) Sunder armor loss is permanent</li>
												or
												<li>2) Using Sunder on a target already affected by Sunder deals Massive damage </li>
											</ul>
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of these upgrades are powerful and directly impact how the Blacksmith plays. Permanent armor loss allows the Blacksmith to be even more of a team player, moving around removing the armor of targets, even if the team isn't yet ready to focus fire on them. Sunder massive damage, on the other hand, 
											allows the Blacksmith to have greatly increased solo or small group utility, allowing the blacksmith to better carry his weight when it comes to dishing out damage.<br />
											<br />
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With over One Hundred unique upgrades to pick from, Ascendancy gives players agency, developing a unique style of play with customized characters to overcome challenges with home-grown tactics and strategies.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											<h2>Dynamic AI</h2>
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the killers of otherwise well designed strategy games is a poorly designed AI opponent. The dynamic AI of Ascendancy is designed to provide an ever-increasing difficulty level without hyperinflating the statistics of 
											bad AI to compensate for it's poor decision making. Initially as you fight in Ascendancy, the AI will be rather lackluster. Charging head-first into combat slashing whoever and whatever. As you advance, and fight more elite 
											soldiers, their decision making increases. Battlefield awareness allows elite soldiers to identify and eliminate exposed targets in vulnerable positions, or break the front lines to execute the weak.
